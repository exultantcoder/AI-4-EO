# üåç Interactive offline AI Tutor: Gemma 3N on Google AI Edge

**No internet. No limits. AI for everyone, everywhere.**

## üìñ Project Vision
This project is about something very simple ‚Äî and very powerful:  
‚ú® Giving every child, no matter where they are in the world, the chance to learn.  

We believe learning is not just about books and exams. It‚Äôs about **dreams, purpose, and access**.  
Technology can make that happen ‚Äî but most AI solutions require internet, data, and heavy infrastructure that many regions just don‚Äôt have.  

That‚Äôs why we built an **personalized interactive learning module**, powered by the **Gemma 3N-e2b-it** and **Gemma 3N -e4b-it** models running on **Google AI Edge Gallery App**.

## üí° What We Built
- **An easy user onboarding system to presonalize the learning experience based on the user's interest and choice in language.**
- **A local learning engine that interacts with the student and adapts questions, difficulty, and encouragement style based on their responses.**  
- **The user's progress on each module is saved.**
- **The model interacts with the user in his language of choice both in audio and text.**
- **Adaptive feedback loop to train the model based on user's preferences to adapt to the user.** 

Instead of asking kids to adapt to the AI, we made the AI **adapt to them**.

## üöÄ Future Scope
- **Deploy on Google AI Edge devices** and benchmark real-world performance.  
- **Expand language support** for global accessibility.  
- **Improve adaptivity** by fine-tuning Gemma with local, private interaction logs.  
- **Enhance multimodality** with lightweight vision transformers.  
- **Partner with NGOs** to bring this system to classrooms worldwide.

## ü§ù Challenges We Faced
- Personalizing content without cloud storage.  
- Staying within power and memory limits on small devices.  

### How We Overcame Them
- Built an interactive learning module as part of the custom task in the google ai edge gallery app.  
- Preloaded essential learning modules (STEM, environment, health, ethics).

# Workflow :
1. Clone the Google AI edge gallery github repo
2. Add these interactive learning task files under the custom task folder and run the interactive module.
