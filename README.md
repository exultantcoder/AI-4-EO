# 🌍 Interactive offline AI Tutor: Gemma 3N on Google AI Edge

**No internet. No limits. AI for everyone, everywhere.**

---

## 📖 Project Vision
This project is about something very simple — and very powerful:  
✨ Giving every child, no matter where they are in the world, the chance to learn.  

We believe learning is not just about books and exams. It’s about **dreams, purpose, and access**.  
Technology can make that happen — but most AI solutions require internet, data, and heavy infrastructure that many regions just don’t have.  

That’s why we built an **personalized interactive learning module**, powered by the **Gemma 3N-e2b-it** and **Gemma 3N -e4b-it** models running on **Google AI Edge Gallery App**.

## 💡 What We Built
- **An interactive custom task designed to be deployed on the official open source Google AI Edge Gallery repo by Google.**
- **An offline personalized learning platform that adapts to the user's language and interests specially for those in children in underserved areas.**
- **TalkToMe option enable the user to chat with the model via image, text and audio , all-in-one tab.**
- **Better user data management and track of user's progress while learning modules.**
- **Adaptive feedback loop to train the model based on user's preferences to adapt to the user.** 

Instead of asking kids to adapt to the AI, we made the AI **adapt to them**.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Deploy on Google AI Edge devices** and benchmark real-world performance.  
- **Expand language support** for global accessibility.  
- **Improve adaptivity** by fine-tuning Gemma with local, private interaction logs.  
- **Enhance multimodality** with lightweight vision transformers.  
- **Partner with NGOs** to bring this system to classrooms worldwide.  
- **Preloaded essential learning modules (STEM, environment, health, ethics).
